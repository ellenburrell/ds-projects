    "The dataset on 2016 voters was very interesting to analyze. Although we only looked very closely at a couple of variables, this data set contains a HUGE amount of potiental for future application. The very essence of a 'Feeling Therometer' surronding different racial, ethic, and diverse groups is VERY interesting to analyze and amazing be able to see the Choice of President for the people with these opinions.\n",
